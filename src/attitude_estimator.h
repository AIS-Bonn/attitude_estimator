	* @class AttitudeEstimator
	*
	* @brief Fuses 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data into an attitude estimate using a nonlinear Passive Complementary Filter.
	*
	* Attitude Estimator is a generic platform-independent C++ library that implements an IMU sensor fusion algorithm. Up to 3-axis gyroscope,
	* accelerometer and magnetometer data can be processed into a full 3D quaternion orientation estimate, with the use of a nonlinear Passive
	* Complementary Filter. The library is targeted at robotic applications, but is by no means limited to this. Features of the estimator
	* include gyro bias estimation, transient quick learning phases, tuneable estimator parameters, and near-global stability backed by
	* theoretical analysis.
	*
	* Great emphasis has been placed on having a very efficient, yet totally numerically and algorithmically robust implementation
	* of the filter. The code size has also been kept to a minimum, and has been extremely well-commented. The programmatic interface
	* has also been made as easy to use as possible. Please refer to the extensive documentation of the library for more information on its
	* capabilities and usage caveats.
	*
	* Attitude Estimator was developed as part of the <a href="http://www.nimbro.net/OP/">NimbRo-OP</a> project at the University of Bonn.
	* 
	* The inputs to the estimator should respect the following guidelines:
	* 
	* - The @b gyroscope data must be in `rad/s`, and should express the measured angular velocity in body-fixed coordinates. If only 2-axis
	*   gyro data is available, then the missing component should simply be set to zero. The attitude estimator in this case will do the best
	*   it can to still estimate the full 3D orientation, but you can expect effective loss of rotational information around one axis.
	*   This can manifest itself in various ways in the output, and it must be decided on a per-situation basis how to best manage the
	*   resulting information loss, so as to minimise resulting performance reduction.
	* 
	* - The @b accelerometer data can be in any self-consistent units, preferably <tt>ms<sup>-2</sup></tt>, and should express the measured
	*   <i><b>inertial acceleration</b></i> in body-fixed coordinates. This is a <i><b>very important point</b></i> to note, or you may
	*   end up giving data of the wrong sign convention to the filter! The convention of supplying an inertial acceleration means specifically
	*   that if gravity is measured to be in one direction, then the supplied accelerometer value should be in exactly the opposite direction.
	*   So for example, if gravity is measured to point down the negative z-axis in body-fixed coordinates, then the accelerometer data provided
	*   to the `update()` function should be the exact negative thereof, pointing in the direction of the positive z-axis (i.e. up). Note that only
	*   the direction of the acceleration vector is considered by the estimator - the magnitude is ignored, unless it is zero of course. If only
	*   2-axis accelerometer data is available, then you may calculate a third component that makes the total magnitude of the acceleration
	*   vector equal to what you expect from gravity. In this case the units and quantitative correctness of the accelerometer values are important.
	* 
	* - The @b magnetometer data can be in any self-consistent units, preferably `gauss` (`Ga`), and should express the measured magnetic field
	*   strength in body-fixed coordinates. If the body is rotated in-place in its environment, then ideally the magnetometer data should stay
	*   within a sphere of some radius that corresponds to the overall magnetic field strength. This data quality may be achieved using hard
	*   and/or soft iron calibrations, as required. If no magnetometer is present in the system, then just pass zero for each component. The
	*   consideration of magnetometer information is automatically disabled in this case. You can also achieve the same effect by setting a zero
	*   magnetometer calibration value (see `setMagCalib()`). Providing a magnetometer calibration value simply makes the difference between having
	*   relative or absolute yaw information encoded in the output quaternion. Note that the magnetometer readings do not influence the pitch and
	*   roll components of the output quaternion state estimate. This was a design decision to limit the invalidation of the state estimation output
	*   in the case of an invalid or inaccurate magnetometer calibration. If only 1-axis compass data is available, then you can mathematically
	*   transform this into a synthesised 3D magnetometer value, based on the current orientation estimate. This is a slightly more involved
	*   calculation however, and is beyond the scope of this discussion.
	* 
	* - The <b>time increment</b> (@c dt) passed to the `update()` function in each step must be expressed in seconds. It is recommended that you
	*   measure the time between the successive calls to the `update()` function using a high resolution timer, and calculate the @c dt value from
	*   this, making sure that you coerce the value of @c dt to a suitable range. The coercion is important to avoid the error
	*   inducing effects of having abnormally large and/or small @c dt values passing through the estimator. For example, if the nominal call rate of
	*   the `update()` function is once per 10ms, then a reasonable coercion range would be something like 8ms to 25ms.
	* 
	* All of the most common issues encountered when attempting to use the AttitudeEstimator class come from passing incorrect, incorrectly signed,
	* and/or badly conditioned data to the `update()` function. *The estimator can't do any better than the data you give it!*
	*
	* It is highly recommended to ensure via experimentation that the x, y and z-axes of the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer readings
	* are consistent with each other, as they must be for the estimator to work correctly. For example, when performing a pure positive x-rotation
	* according to the gyroscope, from an upright position, you should observe that the y-component of the accelerometer reading increases, while
	* the x-component stays constant and the z-component decreases. You should check all (up to) nine sensor readings for such internal consistency.
	*
	* It is also highly recommended that you experimentally confirm that the units of the sensor data values are exactly as you expect, and that
	* reasonable values are being returned from your hardware. For example, when the hardware is stationary you should have that the magnitude
	* of the accelerometer measurement is close to 9.81<tt>ms<sup>-2</sup></tt>, in whatever units you choose to express the accelerations in,
	* and that the gyroscope measurement is in the vague vicinity of zero. You should also observe that the magnetometer data values you are
	* providing lie approximately on a sphere centered at the origin (i.e. constant vector magnitude). This is rarely the case for raw magnetometer
	* measurements, and so you will likely need to do a hard-iron calibration (or equivalent).
	*
	* If there is excessive noise on the data inputs, then there is only so much that the estimator can be expected to filter out while still
	* maintaining its tracking performance (although, incidentally, this balance can be adjusted via the PI gains). In situations like this you
	* would be right to invest time into signal conditioning and/or tracing the true source of the sensor noise.
	*
	* All angles are expressed in radians (e.g. the return values of the `eulerYaw()`, `eulerPitch()` and `eulerRoll()` functions, etc...).
	*
	* The AttitudeEstimator class can be used as follows:
	* @code
	* // Declare an instance of the class (e.g. as a member of another class)
	* AttitudeEstimator Est;
	*
	* // Initialise the estimator (e.g. in the class constructor, none of these are actually strictly required for the estimator to work, and can be set at any time)
	* Est.setMagCalib(0.68, -1.32, 0.0);         // Recommended: Use if you want absolute yaw information as opposed to just relative yaw (Default: (1.0, 0.0, 0.0))
	* Est.setPIGains(2.2, 2.65, 10, 1.25);       // Recommended: Use if the default gains (shown) do not provide optimal estimator performance (Note: Ki = Kp/Ti)
	* Est.setQLTime(2.5);                        // Optional: Use if the default quick learning time is too fast or too slow for your application (Default: 3.0)
	* Est.setAttitude(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5);       // Optional: Use if you have prior knowledge about the orientation of the robot (Default: Identity orientation)
	* Est.setAttitudeEuler(M_PI, 0.0, 0.0);      // Optional: Use if you have prior knowledge about the orientation of the robot (Default: Identity orientation)
	* Est.setAttitudeFused(M_PI, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); // Optional: Use if you have prior knowledge about the orientation of the robot (Default: Identity orientation)
